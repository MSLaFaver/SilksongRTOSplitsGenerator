# SilksongRTOSplitsGenerator
LiveSplit splits (.lss) generator for Silksong Random Tool Order.

The latest release can be downloaded here: [Latest](https://github.com/MSLaFaver/SilksongRTOSplitsGenerator/releases/latest)

How to use:
1. Download the `.exe` to any folder.
2. Double click the `.exe` (or run it with command prompt).
3. The program will generate a random list of tools while honoring prerequisites.
4. The LiveSplits file will be saved in the same directory as the .exe to `rto-Tool-Name.lss`. The name will be based on the first tool in the splits. In the rare event that the filename is identical to another file in the directory, it will overwrite the existing file.
5. This `.lss` file can then be opened by LiveSplit.
